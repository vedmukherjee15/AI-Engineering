India’s geopolitical issues sit at the intersection of unresolved borders, regional instability, great-power competition, and economic/energy security—all amplified by India’s rise as a major Indo-Pacific power.

1 Two-front security pressure: Pakistan and China

Pakistan: terrorism risk + Kashmir flashpoints + escalation management
	•	The Kashmir dispute remains the central political-security fault line, with persistent risks from militancy, cross-border firing, and crisis escalation.  ￼
	•	Recent reporting highlights how militant attacks can quickly trigger rapid military escalation and wider political/diplomatic fallout. (Example: the CFR tracker describes the 2025 escalation dynamics after a deadly attack in Kashmir.)  ￼
	•	Border states and sensitive installations continue to operate under heightened threat environments during periods of elevated alerts.  ￼

What this means geopolitically: India seeks deterrence and escalation control (preventing a spiral), while also keeping diplomatic space open enough to avoid constant crisis.

China: the LAC dispute + competition for regional influence
	•	The Line of Actual Control (LAC) dispute is not only about territory—it’s about strategic leverage in Asia and India’s ability to concentrate resources on growth rather than sustained high-altitude deployments.
	•	While there have been steps like disengagement/patrolling arrangements in parts of eastern Ladakh (Depsang/Demchok), the relationship remains structurally competitive and sensitive to shifts in US-China and China-India dynamics.  ￼

What this means geopolitically: India’s China policy mixes border stabilization (to reduce immediate risk) with strategic balancing (deepening partnerships in the Indo-Pacific).

2 Neighbourhood volatility: influence contests, domestic politics next door, and connectivity

India’s immediate neighbourhood is often its most operationally demanding theatre. Core challenges include:
	•	Competing external influence (especially China’s economic/statecraft footprint), and periodic anti-India political mobilization in nearby countries.
	•	Unresolved bilateral irritants (water sharing, border disputes, fisheries, migration, trade frictions) that can become domestic political issues in neighbouring states.  ￼
	•	The need to deliver credible connectivity and development outcomes fast enough to compete with alternative financing and political narratives.  ￼

What this means geopolitically: India’s “Neighbourhood First” approach is constantly tested by regime changes, public opinion swings, and the hard logistics of building cross-border infrastructure at scale.  ￼

3 Indo-Pacific and the Indian Ocean: maritime security as core geopolitics

India’s strategic geography pushes it toward a maritime-centric posture:
	•	Protecting sea lanes and responding to grey-zone pressures (coercion short of war), piracy, and strategic naval competition.
	•	Building coalitions that support a rules-based maritime order—most visibly via the Quad, which repeatedly emphasizes maritime security, international law, and resilient supply chains.  ￼

What this means geopolitically: India increasingly treats the Indian Ocean as a primary security domain, while also projecting influence into the wider Indo-Pacific through partnerships.

4 Great-power balancing: US, Russia, Europe, Middle East—without “choosing a camp”

India’s external strategy is often described as “multi-alignment”—working with multiple poles to maximize strategic autonomy.

US and partners: technology, defense cooperation, supply chains—plus friction points
	•	India’s alignment with the US and partners is deepening in maritime security and economic/technology resilience frameworks (e.g., Quad agendas).  ￼
	•	But the relationship can face sharp friction when US domestic politics, trade measures, or sanctions policy collide with India’s core interests (notably energy security).  ￼

Russia: defense legacy + energy trade—under sanctions pressure
	•	India’s Russia ties remain significant due to long-standing defense linkages and the post-2022 shift in energy trade patterns, which are now a recurring geopolitical pressure point.  ￼

What this means geopolitically: India is constantly optimizing for strategic autonomy—but autonomy becomes harder when sanctions, wars, and bloc politics tighten the global operating environment.

5 Energy security: the geopolitics of oil, shipping, and sanctions

India’s economy depends heavily on imported energy, so geopolitics shows up directly in domestic inflation, trade balance, and industrial competitiveness.
	•	The expansion of Russian crude in India’s import basket created both economic benefits and diplomatic/sanctions complexity, as seen in recent reporting on compliance windows and restrictions tied to Russian suppliers.  ￼

What this means geopolitically: India has to balance cost-effective supply with reputational and policy risk in Western markets and financial systems.

6 Geo-economics and connectivity corridors

India’s external posture increasingly hinges on trade, standards, and infrastructure diplomacy:
	•	Large connectivity initiatives like the India–Middle East–Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) are framed as strategic economic geography—diversifying routes, reducing chokepoint risk, and binding partners through infrastructure and logistics.  ￼

What this means geopolitically: Competition is not only about borders and fleets, but about who writes the rules, funds the infrastructure, and anchors supply chains.

7 Technology, cyber, and information space

Alongside conventional security, India faces increasing exposure to:
	•	cyber operations, disinformation, and “always-on” information contestation (especially during crises),
	•	dependencies in semiconductors, telecom, and critical digital infrastructure—making “tech sovereignty” a geopolitical issue.

(These themes often show up during India–Pakistan or India–China tensions as part of broader crisis dynamics.)  ￼

Bottom line

India’s geopolitical issues are best understood as a set of linked pressures:
	•	Hard security (Pakistan/China, terrorism, border management),
	•	Regional influence (neighbourhood volatility + connectivity competition),
	•	Maritime geopolitics (Indian Ocean/Indo-Pacific),
	•	Great-power balancing (US partnerships alongside Russia ties),
	•	Energy and geo-economics (sanctions, corridors, supply chains).
